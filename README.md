## Introduction
This project aims to continue of one of the projects initiated by a Roberto Pietrobon, a changemaker from Random Hacks of Kindness.  The goal of CaretoCompare? is to inform users of different health insurance from different providers so that they can decide better which one suits them.

### Why this project
* The project is done in React.JS, a library that I prefer to work on for my last project.

* The project allows me to focus on the front end aspect.  In the future, the front end will use the search api from another project https://github.com/RHoKAustralia/care2compare-search-api, which will be developed using Java by other volunteers. Lastly, there is already a mockup which I can follow.

* I can continue working on it afterwards as the project progresses.

### Technologies

* React.JS and React packages used:
[react-router], [react-social-icons], [react-materialize](https://github.com/react-materialize/react-materialize), [material-ui](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui),[react-slick](https://github.com/akiran/react-slick)

* Javascript, HTML, CSS

###  Accomplished
* Updated the styling of the first three pages (Landing, Details, Search)
(Note: will need another round, but the work done is enough to show the feel, and for me to be able to discuss abt the design and solution for the meeting on 22 August)

### Other tasks

- Nice to have: add setTimer to be called when calling routes.
- Nice to have: implement a nice slider for displaying policy results in Search Result page (there was an error from library in getting element height and it needs further investigation)
- Add [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) lint tool
- More styling and polishing needs to be performed to follow the mockup.
- Consult with UX designers if the use of Google's Material Design / Materialize is ok user experience.
- Ask UX designers more details about the icons, fonts, colors.
